# Hi there!

We are GhostLineSecurity :)
A research group dedicated to investigate, develop and learn about the (so) many interesting fields of cyber-security. 

This static, weird looking, simplistic yet readable, blog has been created with only one thing in mind: Sharing what we learned.

Expect technical and, sometimes even, interesting articles to be periodically posted here.

## Where do we belong?

GhostLineSecurity represents the most technical, and new, branch of Áudea, a company focused on the GRC/legal aspects of cyber security. Until now.

As strange as it seems for a compliance company (·_.), Áudea happened to keep a very open mind regarding what __dealing__ with our kind is. Let's be clear here: We're not the easiest people to work with.

They were happy for us to invest time on R+D, learn new stuff, talk about it... And most importantly, they gave us the tools in no time to achieve it. Also they cut us loose on the leash we were used to regarding R+D.

GhostLineSecurity is a part of the new department we're working to create at Áudea.
